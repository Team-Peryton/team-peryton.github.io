## Previous entries

### Aria, Grand Champion 2021

Aria's idealogy from planning through to testing focused on producing an aircraft capable of winning the competition whilst keeping complexity low. 9 testing days were carried out to ensure the aircraft would perform as expected on the day, going through several design iterations during this process. The team faced many challenges with COVID restrictions but managed to reach their ambitions none the less.

### 2021 Dragonfly

The 4th year volunteer team aircraft, designed to be very efficient with tapered high aspect ratio wings and T tail. Innovatove use of custom composites to make a structurally light tail boom attachment.

### 2020 Wally

4th year volunteer team building on the 2019 3rd year group project learning, focusing on producing an easy to manufacture design. Powered by an internal combustion engine and developing the solarfilm/balsa based wing structure which inspired Arias' wing design. Unfortunatly it was unable to enter competition or flight test due to COVID.

### 2020 Flying Wing

3rd year design project not entered into the IMeche UAS challenge. Developed manufacturing jigs to ease assembly and used custom carbon fibre wrapping to provide an efficient carbon frame.
