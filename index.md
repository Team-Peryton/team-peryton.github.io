## About

We are a group of students based at the University of Surrey consisting of teams focused on competing in the annual IMechE UAS challenge. Having won the competition in 2022 and 2021 we have strong experiance producing capable autonomous UAV solutions. 

You can contact us at *teamperyton@surrey.ac.uk*

## This years teams

### Team Peryton Heron
Consisting of the remaining 4th year Aria 2021 team as well as students from all years and degrees across the university. We're building upon our previous success and learning, pushing boundaries across all sub-systems. 
- We've created a single propeller pusher to increase propulsion efficiency, reducing propulsion system and battery mass;
- We're using custom composite parts to maximise part strength to weight ratio, while using environmentally friendly flax weave to reduce environmental impact;
- We've reduced our core avionics costs by over 50% compared to last year, using custom electronics and software as well as optimising COTS purchases;
- We've flown many flights with our trainer to collect image recognition data and ensure avionics robustness.

### Team Peryton Atlantis
We are the third-year team and this will be our first year participating in the UAS Challenge. Our team consists of Aerospace Engineering students and one Mechanical Engineering student. We also have team members returning from industrial placements, bringing with them a plethora of knowledge to apply to this competition. We are keen to demonstrate our engineering abilities and creative thinking which is why we are developing a VTOL aircraft for this year's competition. 
- Our aircraft is equipped with 5 motors: 4 dedicated lift motors and 1 tractor motor
- Our design is capable of vertical flight and hovering with the aim of maximising payload drop accuracy
- Our aircraft will also have a fixed-wing enabling more power-efficient transit between tasks whilst minimising mission time
- We have incorporated the payload inside the fuselage of our aircraft to maximise aerodynamic efficiency
- We will be using carbon fibre composites to construct the weight-efficient skeleton of our aircraft

## Previous entries

### Aria, Grand Champion 2021

Aria's ideology from planning through to testing focused on producing an aircraft capable of winning the competition whilst keeping complexity low. 9 testing days were carried out to ensure the aircraft would perform as expected on the day, going through several design iterations during this process. The team faced many challenges with COVID restrictions but managed to reach their ambitions none the less.

### 2021 Dragonfly

The 4th year volunteer team aircraft, designed to be very efficient with tapered high aspect ratio wings and T tail. Innovative use of custom composites to make a structurally light tail boom attachment.

### 2020 Wally

4th year volunteer team building on the 2019 3rd year group project learning, focusing on producing an easy to manufacture design. Powered by an internal combustion engine and developing the solarfilm/balsa based wing structure which inspired Arias' wing design. Unfortunately it was unable to enter competition or flight test due to COVID.

### 2020 Flying Wing

3rd year design project not entered into the IMeche UAS challenge. Developed manufacturing jigs to ease assembly and used custom carbon fibre wrapping to provide an efficient carbon frame.
