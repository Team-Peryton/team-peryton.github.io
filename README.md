## Team Peryton

Our website, https://team-peryton.github.io, using GitHub Pages and Jekyll.

## How To Make Changes

- You'll need a github account and know how to use it. This is a guide on Github: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world if you don't know how to use it then it's a very good life skill tbh.
- Need to have read/write access to this repository, ask project supervisor for this.
- Google "Markdown" and have a read about it.
- index.md is what you want to edit
- For the most part, you should be able to use the existing structure and just add text n images and stuff. Just copy and paste bits from the rest of the website and change the text.
